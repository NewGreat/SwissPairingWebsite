# Tournament App
Application largely intended for Warmachine/hordes EO's to make things easier

I have three goals with this project:
1. Create an open source community resource for running events/tournaments
2. Create something easy to use
3. Create something portable

Goal 1:
Its open sourced, license update to come later once I have something deliverable

Goal 2:
The ultimate form of this will be a website that is reachable by any browser at any time. Just sign in and view your active tournaments and pairings.

Goal 3:
Reporting will be done automatically from any participant and validated by the EO/TO and their delegates and will work on desktop and mobile browsers. No app, no fancy pluggins just log in and play
